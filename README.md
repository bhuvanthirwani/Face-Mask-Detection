# Face-Mask-Detection-Using-CNN-and-OpenCV
A normal Real Time Face Mask Detection.

How to Run???
Steps:-
1.Simply you have to open Real Time Analysis.ipynb file from Jupyter notebook or lab.
2.Run Cells one by one.
3.Open Camera Window from botton bar(if not opened).
4.Move your face in front of the camera.
5. Optional-To get different results you can take the colabmodel as a CNN Classifier. To do this you just need to rename the file to colabmodel.h5 while loading the model in one of the cells of Real Time Analysis.ipynb.
Note:-Current results are from model.h5.
So basically I have provided two models. I get better results from model.h5. But you can play with them.
There is also Sample Video in repository to how to place our face in front of camera.
Enjoy.
