# Face-Mask-Detection-Using-CNN-and-OpenCV
A normal Real Time Face Mask Detection.

How to Run???<br/>
Steps:- <br/>
1.Simply you have to open Real Time Analysis.ipynb file from Jupyter notebook or lab.<br/>
2.Run Cells one by one.<br/>
3.Open Camera Window from botton bar(if not opened).<br/>
4.Move your face in front of the camera.<br/>
5. Optional-To get different results you can take the colabmodel as a CNN Classifier.<br/>
To do this you just need to rename the file to colabmodel.h5 while loading the model in one of the cells of Real Time Analysis.ipynb.<br/>
Note:-Current results are from model.h5.<br/>
So basically I have provided two models.<br/>
I get better results from model.h5.
But you can play with them.<br/>
There is also Sample Video in repository to how to place our face in front of camera.<br/>
Enjoy.<br/>
